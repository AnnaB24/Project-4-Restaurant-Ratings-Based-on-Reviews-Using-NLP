We went today, a weds, there was no wait and we were seated promptly. We were informed that the beverages was self serve as far as coffee, water, tea and lemonade goes. We started with tea-dislike, then lemonade-dislike. And did I mention we self served ourselves in a 12 oz cup with a price of $2.75, WOW! If it was to our liking, Id say that is still steep for a self serve drink in a 12oz cup. He had the monte cristo, which he liked but was not blown away for the price. I had the french toast and it was only ok. I also ordered a side of sausage that i DISLIKED and it was $4 for I think 2 links, WOW. And once our food came, the flys were EVERYHWERE. I kid you not when I say I couldnt wait to get outta there. I left very disappointed, and hungry. Will never return or recommend. But hey, try it for yourself, you may like it. I just think it was too high priced for what we got.</td>\n",

What a disappointment. \\n\\nWe were seated within 20 minutes or so of arrival, which was great considering the crowd. It was nice to have somewhere to walk around, and we were able to serve ourselves tea and coffee while we waited. \\n\\nOnce seated, however, it took 20 minutes for anyone to take our order, and another 45 for the food to come. Our food arrived cold. Husband and I both ordered eggs \"over medium;\" mine were runny and undercooked, his were hard and scaly. \"Home fries\" were a mound of mushy, under-seasoned potatoes. We were offered jam when the food came, but the waitress never returned with it. My husband asked one of the other staff if they had any jam, received a curt, \"yes\" as a reply, but they didn't offer to help in any way. \\n\\nFor the prices (average $10 plus $2.25 for a self-serve drink), I can think of many places I'd rather spend my dining dollars. Yes, the grounds are lovely and I like that most of the food is from local suppliers (which does not mean it was raised on THIS farm, BTW), but there are many lovely patios in Phoenix with much better food and service.</td>\n",

The grounds were beautiful and we truly felt like we've \"left town\" and was at someplace else.  There is usually a line for breakfast but once you sign in you can walk the grounds and garden or sit on the outside patio (in front of the other restaurant that's only open for dinner).  This place is also dog friendly and if you get a drink from the bakery up front, you can refill it at the cafe when you sit down for breakfast.\\n\\nWhen we come here, we always go for the French Toast and something else.  Have you ever had something so good that it ruins it for you to get it anywhere else?  This is what their French Toast did to me...from that moment on...all French Toasts will be compared to this one.  The bread they use is super light and fluffy, sprinkled w/toasted pecan &amp; served w/warm &amp; silky maple syrup.  It's really simple...yet so unbelievably delicious.\\n\\nWe usually also get some sort of egg breakfast and they've been pretty good.  Their potatoes are also good and I always request mine extra crispy like my bacon.\\n\\nAnother plus is they have fresh-squeezed OJ and the service is always prompt, courteous and mindful.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Morning Glory (along with the Farm Kitchen, the other more casual dining spot at the Farm at South Mountain) re-opened on September 9th after being closed for the summer. We missed being able to go there for breakfast, but on the other hand, would not have been happy or comfortable sitting outside with a hot breakfast in the broiling Phoenix sun and my thighs sticking to the plastic chair. Right. So, it's a good idea that they close for the summer. But I digress. \\n\\nI have three reasons for my update: \\n\\n1. The Monte Cristo sandwich was still delicious (those farm-fresh eggs and cheese are so good!), but the bread that was so crispy and artisan last time was soggy and too syrupy this time. Note to chefs: the bread is what makes the sandwich complete, so get it right. \\n2. The chicken fried steak (served with creamy gravy and rosemary potatoes and topped with one of their delicious, farm-raised eggs) was ridiculously good. The batter was light and crispy and the gravy was the perfect creamy and pepper complement. Try it. You won't regret it. \\n3. When the server offers you a muffin or pastry after taking your order, don't accept unless you want to pay $2.50 for it. We fell for that trick and ended up paying for an orange muffin that was ok but kind of filled us up before we got to the good stuff. \\n\\nDefinitely still amazing, and definitely still worth checking out. I don't think the lunch spot (Farm Kitchen) is as delicious, so if you're only going to pick one of the two, definitely try Morning Glory. Of course, you could also opt for Quiessence, the formal restaurant at the Farm, which I still haven't tried but hear is awesome. A sign at the Farm said they are now open for lunch and afternoon snacks. But, again, I digress.</td>\n",

Although we were a bit confused on which restaurant was which, we ended up landing at the Morning Glory Cafe.  I must add, as other reviewers have noted, the scenery here is wonderful and unique.  That alone is a reason to stop by, but as food goes, I might just bring a picnic lunch or get lunch at the grill when I come back next time.\\n\\nI found the food to be mediocre at best.  I had the breakfast tacos, which were served in a hard shell - I didn't know restaurants served those anymore, especially on a breakfast taco.  The taste was fresh, minus the shell, but nothing special that I couldn't make myself at home.  The potatoes on the side had good flavor, but I would have preferred them to be crispier... they were rather soft.  The Hubs had the french toast, which he seemed to love.  I really saw him enjoying the candied pecans on top.  I liked the self serve lemonade/tea/coffee, although non were anything to write home about.\\n\\nSo, if you're in the area and want to experience something different, I say why not try Morning Glory Cafe.  For me, next time I will try the deli/grill place at the front.  I love the idea of a picnic here on a beautiful spring or fall day.  Can't beat that!</td>\n",

We were a bit squished but it worked out fine. I will admit we were a little worried since our taxi driver had no clue what we were talking about but he found it and it was beautiful from the moment we pulled up. \\n\\nAnyways, the atmosphere was wonderful, really laid back. The drinks (minus mimosas) were all self-serve. My fiancé is a bit of an eggs benedict snob and he loved them!

The french toast was melt in your mouth and the over easy eggs added a nice level of texture.  I was a little scared when I saw the sandwich drowning in maple syrup, but was pleasantly surprised when it wasn't overly sweet.  I also liked getting my own coffee as I felt their service was a little slow.  I have been looking for a brunch joint in Phoenix and I think I found a winner.  \\n\\nOh yeah, this is also a nice place to bring your 4-legged friend if you have one.</td>\n",

Morning Glory  is a great little out of the way place .Seating is all outside and the view is near Maya's Garden and Quiescence. It has that \"local\" vibe , people are streaming in in their hiking and biking  clothes, families with kids and dogs in tow seem to have been here before.   We were quickly seated passing by a waitress with two platters with the French toast / Monte Cristo type sandwich . Big enough to feed a family of five..Holy Guacamole as my 2nd graders say. \\nWe settle in after getting ourselves  either tea, water or lemonade.. can't decide if i love or hate this... get your own beverage..  yeah I can get my own whenever I  want.... oh dang I got to get up again and get my drink ... \\nI ordered the South Mountain Omelet which has the on site grown veggies from Maya's . Heavy on the zucchini   light on the goat cheese, very tasty.  A small but tasty biscuit came with it.   Friend enjoyed their egg sandwiches and all were happy and content. \\n\\nLight mental note --this is outside on a \"farm/garden\" there will be bright sun and we had a lot of flies. Off putting for some ..not us. \\n\\nCute little place definitely going on my take mom here list. I'll be back.</td>\n",

But now I know all I need to do is swing by Morning Glory and the rest of the farm. \\n\\nMy group of 6 arrived at 10:30am for brunch on a Saturday. The place was PACKED! Always a good sign I say. We waited about 1/2 hour to get our table but time flew by with conversations and relaxing/taking in the scenery of the farm. Once seated we all pulled out pens and drew all over our butcher paper table cloth. Us 20/30 something year olds turned into 7 year olds drawing all over the table. \\n\\nOur service was great! For as crazy busy as they were everything came out tasting wonderful! I ordered up the eggs benedict. All of the egg dishes use the farms eggs from chickens you can see for yourself just a few yards away. Yum yum! I also got to sample some of my friends applewood smoked bacon. OMG! This bacon will make you drool for more! In her words \"They really smoke it with real apples!\" hehe One of the best parts of the meal that really impressed me was that they have a self serve station for water, tea and coffee. I liked not having to wait for our waitress to bring me more water or coffee I could just jump up and get it myself. \\n\\nDon't try to make this a quick stop for breakfast or brunch. Plan to spend the morning or afternoon there and take in the relaxing outdoors, the restaurant, farm and to local shopping just steps away. Enjoy and relax!</td>\n",

The bucolic country ambiance I found nice (though not for everyone).\\n\\nThe food was totally pedestrian. I could cook everything myself and do a better job.  The one of the poached eggs was cooked all the way through.   The cowboy chili and eggs weren't great (the meat in the chili was really grainy and tough).    I had the breakfast tacos, and it was fine -- the chorizo wasn't as good as you can get in the valley.  The self-serve coffee and lemonade was nice.

The grounds are beautiful with huge grassy areas, picnic tables, huge gardens, etc.  We had breakfast here.  I had the South Mountain omelet with goat cheese and sauteed vegetables from their garden (zucchini, red pepper, onion, fennel, cauliflower).  You can not get more farm to table than this place.   My boyfriend had eggs benedict and he said the sauce was the best he has ever had - very rich.  He said the sauteed greens on the benedict was a nice touch.  It's very casual and it was packed.\\n\\nI definitely want to try the dinner restaurant, Quintessa?   It is expensive but would be such a great experience.  They said he butchers his own meat and flies in fresh seafood every day.   Yummy!</td>\n",

The setting seems a world away from the city, but it took less than 10 minutes to get to the airport.  Parking signs direct cars to park across the street, so I did, but one can actually drive back to the Morning Glory Cafe.  I didn't mind the 4 minute walk as the grounds are beautiful.  I sat on the patio overlooking the gardens.  Since the waitress asked if I wanted something to drink, I assumed she would provide it.  She informed me that coffee, tea and lemonade were behind me and it was self serve.  No biggy - but all the cups were disposable, including clear plastic cups for water (not necessarily a huge deal if they didn't tout their recycling efforts and sustainability on the back of the menu).  The coffee was very weak... and I tried 2 different containers.  Boo! \\n\\nService was good even with a packed patio.  They did use their farm ingredients in many of the dishes.  I ordered the white truffle scrambled egg &amp; local veggie skillet, which came with sauteed cauliflower, peas, green beans, and a couple strips of spinach.  The veggies were fresh, but the dish lacked flavor.  Maybe I was expecting some fresh herbs or more seasoning?  \\n\\nThe setting is a 4, the service is a 3-4, but the food which is the most important part - a 3.  I would go back to try one of the other two restaurants.  Lunch on the picnic benches or a nicer dinner at Quiessence, with daily menu changes, sounds appealing.</td>\n",

My 2 year old daughter liked the moussaka, too!  The bouncy houses were nice and fairly priced.  There was lots of room to run around and play.  I loved the food  variety they offered including hot dogs in case the little ones didn't care for Greek food.  The loukamades, though, were too expensive. The dolmades were unbelievably a bargain.  Three meat filled grape leaves for $2!  They charge $6-7 at a local restaurant for the same 3!  I ate 3 in their cafe and took another 3 home.  Spanakopita was also delicious.  Better than the restaurant!  I am so lucky to live in AZ with so many great festivals.  Not homesick anymore!  I've lived here in AZ for 9 years now, too.</td>\n",

We booked our Grand Canyon tour several weeks in advance, but they called to cancel LAST MINUTE (literally 5pm on the Sunday before our Monday tour).  The customer service rep cited weather issues and told us that given their 25 years of experience, there would be fog in the canyon and it really wouldn't be worth the trip up there.\\n\\nAfter about an hour of wallowing in dejection, we optimistically decided to just try calling around to see if any other tour companies were operating.  Every single tour company we called (we went to tripadvisor and started with the highest rated) was still operating tours to the Grand Canyon but many of them were full.  We finally managed to snag the last 2 spots with another company and there were absolutely NO visibility issues at all.  In fact, the day was extremely clear and the Grand Canyon was spectacular.\\n\\nOpen Road Tours was extremely unprofessional in not helping us find an alternate way to see the Grand Canyon after we expressed that it was our whole purpose in visiting Phoenix and the day we booked was the only day we could go.  Rather than call peers to secure us spots, they told us there was nothing they could do unless we wanted to book on another day (impossible since we were leaving the next day).  Given that there were absolutely no actual weather issues, and they had actually already attempted to reschedule the tour prior to the \"weather cancellation\" due to insufficient bookings on Monday, the entire experience leaves a bad taste in my mouth.\\n\\nPARTING THOUGHT: Why take a chance with your vacation and book with an unreliable tour company when there are so many excellent options in the area?</td>\n",

So now I'm at $66 for a few more months, and then it'll jump to $90.

I explained since they were no longer able to provide the channels that I signed up for, they should let me out of this contract.... but I was told the contract clearly states that programming may change. \\n\\nSo basically, if you sign up with Directv, you are agreeing to give them money, whatever amount they choose... and they agree to give you 250 channels of infomercials... or whatever channels they choose.

       "      <td>After reading a couple of the reviews on here I felt I should write a review based on my experience and advice my neighbor gave me, who is an installer.  The first thing you want to do is make sure you sign up through Directv corporate.  This means calling the number you see advertised on tv and through their website.  One reason for this is the installer must adhere to strict guidelines regarding dish mounting, cable runs and grounding.  The installer must also use only Directv approved cable and other installation materials.  To make sure these guidelines are followed, Directv sends quality control teams to randomly inspect installs.  This ensures you get a quality install which significantly lowers the chance  of service calls.\\n\\nThe other side of Directv is called the \"retail\" side.  These are independent contracters that set up booths inside of stores such as Best Buy, Walmart and Costco.  Generally these retailers are not bound by the rules of Directv corporate.  There are no quality control teams doing inspections and the installers can use substandard or cheaper cable and materials with no repercussions.  Also there may be extra installation charges called custom fees that Directv corporate usually would cover.  This includes special mounts that Directv gives away for free just to get your business.   Usually retailers aren't required to perform background checks on there installers.  \\n\\nOne last tip is regarding their protection plan.  Its a monthly fee you pay that covers you against service calls and equipment failure.  Usually resetting the receiver will resolve any issues.  If it seems like the receiver is just dead or you aren't getting any service, add the protection plan before you call in to schedule a service call so you aren't charged.</td>\n",

I loved their dress selection - several were really unique and fun. Brands such as Velvet, Diane von Furstenberg, Frankie B, Corey Lynn Calter are the ones that come to mind when I remember this place. I just loved the selection of tops, jeans, dresses, skirts - dressy and casual. The girl that helped me was super friendly and helpful and not at all pretentious. I will definitely be back here to visit....nothing I tried on really wowed me this time, but there were so many things that I wished had worked because I truly loved them. My husband and bank account are probably thankful that nothing fit this time, though!</td>\n",

It's one of those stores where you really need to go through every rack, but it's fun because each item just gets better and better. Plus the store is organized very well, so it's not overwhelming as some other stores can be.  I loved how there were so many Diane Von Furstenburg dresses...I will most definitely be back for those! I was on a mission for party dresses today, and unfortunately didn't find any I was in love with at Twist. I did find a handful of other stuff I could have bought, but I restrained myself.  I will be stopping in Twist next time I am up at Fashion Square because the clothes and prices were right up my alley.</td>\n",

       "0       My wife took me here on my birthday for breakfast and it was excellent.  The weather was perfect which made sitting outside overlooking their grounds an absolute pleasure.  Our waitress was excellent and our food arrived quickly on the semi-busy Saturday morning.  It looked like the place fills up pretty quickly so the earlier you get here the better.\\n\\nDo yourself a favor and get their Bloody Mary.  It was phenomenal and simply the best I've ever had.  I'm pretty sure they only use ingredients from their garden and blend them fresh when you order it.  It was amazing.\\n\\nWhile EVERYTHING on the menu looks excellent, I had the white truffle scrambled eggs vegetable skillet and it was tasty and delicious.  It came with 2 pieces of their griddled bread with was amazing and it absolutely made the meal complete.  It was the best \"toast\" I've ever had.\\n\\nAnyway, I can't wait to go back!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "1       Finally was able to make it here for breakfast. My opinion, I will NOT be back. As we were walking up to the place, I said \"O now this is the kind of place we should be taking our out of town visitors.\". Well, on 2nd thought, NO. We went today, a weds, there was no wait and we were seated promptly. We were informed that the beverages was self serve as far as coffee, water, tea and lemonade goes. We started with tea-dislike, then lemonade-dislike. And did I mention we self served ourselves in a 12 oz cup with a price of $2.75, WOW! If it was to our liking, Id say that is still steep for a self serve drink in a 12oz cup. He had the monte cristo, which he liked but was not blown away for the price. I had the french toast and it was only ok. I also ordered a side of sausage that i DISLIKED and it was $4 for I think 2 links, WOW. And once our food came, the flys were EVERYHWERE. I kid you not when I say I couldnt wait to get outta there. I left very disappointed, and hungry. Will never return or recommend. But hey, try it for yourself, you may like it. I just think it was too high priced for what we got.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "2       :( I really wanted to like this place. I thoroughly enjoyed the farm, but I will review it separately. We were greeted by a busy waiter who quickly pointed to self-serve drinks (coffee, tea, water and lemonade) and ran off. We helped ourselves to some coffee and lemonade before we received our menus which stated that each drink was $2.75. I ordered the white truffled scrambled egg skillet (white truffles are my fave). I did not detect one bit of truffle essence in this dish. My fiance ordered the Cowboy Breakfast. It was like watered down chili with and egg on top. No great. The concept is great, but the way in which the food is prepared is super disappointing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "3       Loved the scenic restaurant, right in the middle of the farm.

       "4       Beautiful country setting in Phoenix on an old farm. Watch closely because it is easy to miss as it is actually an old farm near the Legacy Golf resort at South Mountain. \\nVery good home made breakfast with fresh ingredients from the farm. \\nOrange juice was fresh and tasty. \\nEggs and bacon were very good. Biscuits and gravy were excellent. \\nThe setting was the star of this breakfast!\\nI would recommend ! You won't be sorry !                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "5       I so wanted to love this place. I'd heard great things about the food, love the concept and was looking forward to a wonderful experience. What a disappointment. \\n\\nWe were seated within 20 minutes or so of arrival, which was great considering the crowd. It was nice to have somewhere to walk around, and we were able to serve ourselves tea and coffee while we waited. \\n\\nOnce seated, however, it took 20 minutes for anyone to take our order, and another 45 for the food to come. Our food arrived cold. Husband and I both ordered eggs \"over medium;\" mine were runny and undercooked, his were hard and scaly. \"Home fries\" were a mound of mushy, under-seasoned potatoes. We were offered jam when the food came, but the waitress never returned with it. My husband asked one of the other staff if they had any jam, received a curt, \"yes\" as a reply, but they didn't offer to help in any way. \\n\\nFor the prices (average $10 plus $2.25 for a self-serve drink), I can think of many places I'd rather spend my dining dollars. Yes, the grounds are lovely and I like that most of the food is from local suppliers (which does not mean it was raised on THIS farm, BTW), but there are many lovely patios in Phoenix with much better food and service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

       "7       I love every place on South Mountain. I've been wanting to try a Monte Cristo for awhile now. The wait was well worth it. Massive flavor explosion in the mouth.

       "9       This place has been on our to-do list for over a year before we finally made it here...and I could have kicked myself for waiting so long!\\n\\nUpon arrival, we were immediately taken w/the place.  The grounds were beautiful and we truly felt like we've \"left town\" and was at someplace else.  There is usually a line for breakfast but once you sign in you can walk the grounds and garden or sit on the outside patio (in front of the other restaurant that's only open for dinner).  This place is also dog friendly and if you get a drink from the bakery up front, you can refill it at the cafe when you sit down for breakfast.\\n\\nWhen we come here, we always go for the French Toast and something else.  Have you ever had something so good that it ruins it for you to get it anywhere else?  This is what their French Toast did to me...from that moment on...all French Toasts will be compared to this one.  The bread they use is super light and fluffy, sprinkled w/toasted pecan & served w/warm & silky maple syrup.  It's really simple...yet so unbelievably delicious.\\n\\nWe usually also get some sort of egg breakfast and they've been pretty good.  Their potatoes are also good and I always request mine extra crispy like my bacon.\\n\\nAnother plus is they have fresh-squeezed OJ and the service is always prompt, courteous and mindful.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "10      Morning Glory (along with the Farm Kitchen, the other more casual dining spot at the Farm at South Mountain) re-opened on September 9th after being closed for the summer. We missed being able to go there for breakfast, but on the other hand, would not have been happy or comfortable sitting outside with a hot breakfast in the broiling Phoenix sun and my thighs sticking to the plastic chair. Right. So, it's a good idea that they close for the summer. But I digress. \\n\\nI have three reasons for my update: \\n\\n1. The Monte Cristo sandwich was still delicious (those farm-fresh eggs and cheese are so good!), but the bread that was so crispy and artisan last time was soggy and too syrupy this time. Note to chefs: the bread is what makes the sandwich complete, so get it right. \\n2. The chicken fried steak (served with creamy gravy and rosemary potatoes and topped with one of their delicious, farm-raised eggs) was ridiculously good. The batter was light and crispy and the gravy was the perfect creamy and pepper complement. Try it. You won't regret it. \\n3. When the server offers you a muffin or pastry after taking your order, don't accept unless you want to pay $2.50 for it. We fell for that trick and ended up paying for an orange muffin that was ok but kind of filled us up before we got to the good stuff. \\n\\nDefinitely still amazing, and definitely still worth checking out. I don't think the lunch spot (Farm Kitchen) is as delicious, so if you're only going to pick one of the two, definitely try Morning Glory. Of course, you could also opt for Quiessence, the formal restaurant at the Farm, which I still haven't tried but hear is awesome. A sign at the Farm said they are now open for lunch and afternoon snacks. But, again, I digress.                                  \n",
       "11      Best breakie/brunch food EVER! The food is great and the organic coffee is yummy. My Fiance and I are having our wedding at the Farm and specifically wanted a brunch wedding so that we could eat the yummy breakfast food.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "12      After hitting up the downtown farmers market this past Saturday, the Hubs and I decided to give the Farm at South Mountain a try, since we are rarely in this area.  Although we were a bit confused on which restaurant was which, we ended up landing at the Morning Glory Cafe.  I must add, as other reviewers have noted, the scenery here is wonderful and unique.  That alone is a reason to stop by, but as food goes, I might just bring a picnic lunch or get lunch at the grill when I come back next time.\\n\\nI found the food to be mediocre at best.  I had the breakfast tacos, which were served in a hard shell - I didn't know restaurants served those anymore, especially on a breakfast taco.  The taste was fresh, minus the shell, but nothing special that I couldn't make myself at home.  The potatoes on the side had good flavor, but I would have preferred them to be crispier... they were rather soft.  The Hubs had the french toast, which he seemed to love.  I really saw him enjoying the candied pecans on top.  I liked the self serve lemonade/tea/coffee, although non were anything to write home about.\\n\\nSo, if you're in the area and want to experience something different, I say why not try Morning Glory Cafe.  For me, next time I will try the deli/grill place at the front.  I love the idea of a picnic here on a beautiful spring or fall day.  Can't beat that!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "13      We were visiting Phoenix for a friend's wedding and wanted a place to go for brunch the next morning. We went for Sunday brunch with friends, including the bride & groom. It was completely crowded by the time we showed up at 9:30am but they offered us a table for 4 after about 15 minutes (there were 6 of us) and they seated us without our whole party since we were waiting on people. We were a bit squished but it worked out fine. I will admit we were a little worried since our taxi driver had no clue what we were talking about but he found it and it was beautiful from the moment we pulled up. \\n\\nAnyways, the atmosphere was wonderful, really laid back. The drinks (minus mimosas) were all self-serve. My fiancé is a bit of an eggs benedict snob and he loved them! The portions are a little small for the price but it was very different from anything else I've seen in the area. Would go again if we're in town.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "16      A great place to enjoy a meal outside.  The farm was serene and the weather was perfect.  The Farm Monte Cristo, a \"french toast sandwich\" with ham and eggs, was very tasty.  The french toast was melt in your mouth and the over easy eggs added a nice level of texture.  I was a little scared when I saw the sandwich drowning in maple syrup, but was pleasantly surprised when it wasn't overly sweet.  I also liked getting my own coffee as I felt their service was a little slow.

Whether it's breakfast, lunch or dinner try this haven - you will be so happy you did.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "18      Enjoyed a lovely brunchy meal with some darling friends. We have fun trying new places every couple of months or so .. and Saturday's  adventure was the Farm.   Morning Glory  is a great little out of the way place .Seating is all outside and the view is near Maya's Garden and Quiescence. It has that \"local\" vibe , people are streaming in in their hiking and biking  clothes, families with kids and dogs in tow seem to have been here before.   We were quickly seated passing by a waitress with two platters with the French toast / Monte Cristo type sandwich . Big enough to feed a family of five..Holy Guacamole as my 2nd graders say. \\nWe settle in after getting ourselves  either tea, water or lemonade.. can't decide if i love or hate this... get your own beverage..  yeah I can get my own whenever I  want.... oh dang I got to get up again and get my drink ... \\nI ordered the South Mountain Omelet which has the on site grown veggies from Maya's . Heavy on the zucchini   light on the goat cheese, very tasty.  A small but tasty biscuit came with it.   Friend enjoyed their egg sandwiches and all were happy and content. \\n\\nLight mental note --this is outside on a \"farm/garden\" there will be bright sun and we had a lot of flies. Off putting for some ..not us. \\n\\nCute little place definitely going on my take mom here list. I'll be back.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "19      Awesome fresh ingredients, great fresh-baked scones, and an awesome location at the back of the Farm at South Mountain. \\n\\nMorning Glory cafe has amazing omelettes--the Greek and Farm are my favorites. They also have delicious french toast.\\n\\nIf you have friends come in from out of town this is the ideal place to take them for a Sunday brunch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "20      In the middle of the big city it is really hard to find a peaceful outdoor space to escape. But now I know all I need to do is swing by Morning Glory and the rest of the farm. \\n\\nMy group of 6 arrived at 10:30am for brunch on a Saturday. The place was PACKED! Always a good sign I say. We waited about 1/2 hour to get our table but time flew by with conversations and relaxing/taking in the scenery of the farm. Once seated we all pulled out pens and drew all over our butcher paper table cloth. Us 20/30 something year olds turned into 7 year olds drawing all over the table. \\n\\nOur service was great! For as crazy busy as they were everything came out tasting wonderful! I ordered up the eggs benedict. All of the egg dishes use the farms eggs from chickens you can see for yourself just a few yards away. Yum yum! I also got to sample some of my friends applewood smoked bacon. OMG! This bacon will make you drool for more! In her words \"They really smoke it with real apples!\" hehe One of the best parts of the meal that really impressed me was that they have a self serve station for water, tea and coffee. I liked not having to wait for our waitress to bring me more water or coffee I could just jump up and get it myself. \\n\\nDon't try to make this a quick stop for breakfast or brunch. Plan to spend the morning or afternoon there and take in the relaxing outdoors, the restaurant, farm and to local shopping just steps away. Enjoy and relax!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "21      Great food. Kid and dog friendly. Great place for a weekend breakfast. We always bring visitors here. Outdoor casual seating.

       "22      Yummy brunch in a cute setting.  The restaurant is one of three on a farm.  The Morning Glory Cafe is devoted to breakfast/brunch items while the other two restaurants serve lunch and dinner.  I had the Farm Monte Cristo -- the perfect combination of salty and sweet.  The eggs were cooked just the way I like them.  The Morning Glory Benedict was also excellent.  Loved the farm greens on the benedict, tasted very fresh.

       "24      What a beautiful setting to eat breakfast in.  That's why I'm giving it four stars.  The eggs were yummy, the potatoes a little dry, and the coffee I would have preferred in an actual mug instead of a throw-away cup, although it did allow me to carry it around as we roamed the beautiful farm after eating.  What a nice way to spend a weekend morning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "25      What a cute little place to have breakfast! \\nI just recently attended a bridal shower brunch here and it was so cute!  \\nThe food was super tasty, I had the creamy corn porridge with maple glazed sausage and cinnamon sugar roasted apples. I took a chance on it, it sounded like it had a 50/50 chance of being either really good or really heinous! And boy was I glad when it came out and was soooo good! \\nThis place could be 5 stars if the staff wasn't so lax and a little more attentive. This was the whole table (8 ladies) first time coming to this place, we were not instructed that drinks were self serves for the basics (water, coffee, juice) we had to figure that out on our own, and no one at our table was asked if they would like a mimosa or any other drink other then the self serve stuff. \\nI do look forward to going back!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "26      After reading the reviews, I was shocked by the quality of this place.  I went in early May and found that they only had outdoor seating with no misters/fans which made having brunch in 90' heat unpleasant. \\nThe trees were shedding into the food (there are things known as umbrellas).  The bucolic country ambiance I found nice (though not for everyone).\\n\\nThe food was totally pedestrian. I could cook everything myself and do a better job.  The one of the poached eggs was cooked all the way through.   The cowboy chili and eggs weren't great (the meat in the chili was really grainy and tough).    I had the breakfast tacos, and it was fine -- the chorizo wasn't as good as you can get in the valley.  The self-serve coffee and lemonade was nice.   But there wasn't anything write home about.\\n\\nIn summary this is a low 2* review (I reserve 1* for places that can make you sick).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "27      Loved this place, it is so quaint.  We happen to be in the neighborhood and i've always wanted to try this place.  The grounds are beautiful with huge grassy areas, picnic tables, huge gardens, etc.  We had breakfast here.  I had the South Mountain omelet with goat cheese and sauteed vegetables from their garden (zucchini, red pepper, onion, fennel, cauliflower).  You can not get more farm to table than this place.   My boyfriend had eggs benedict and he said the sauce was the best he has ever had - very rich.  He said the sauteed greens on the benedict was a nice touch.  It's very casual and it was packed.\\n\\nI definitely want to try the dinner restaurant, Quintessa?   It is expensive but would be such a great experience.  They said he butchers his own meat and flies in fresh seafood every day.

       "28      Was visiting the area on business and specifically looked for a cafe with organic menu items.  The setting seems a world away from the city, but it took less than 10 minutes to get to the airport.  Parking signs direct cars to park across the street, so I did, but one can actually drive back to the Morning Glory Cafe.  I didn't mind the 4 minute walk as the grounds are beautiful.  I sat on the patio overlooking the gardens.  Since the waitress asked if I wanted something to drink, I assumed she would provide it.  She informed me that coffee, tea and lemonade were behind me and it was self serve.  No biggy - but all the cups were disposable, including clear plastic cups for water (not necessarily a huge deal if they didn't tout their recycling efforts and sustainability on the back of the menu).  The coffee was very weak... and I tried 2 different containers.  Boo! \\n\\nService was good even with a packed patio.  They did use their farm ingredients in many of the dishes.  I ordered the white truffle scrambled egg & local veggie skillet, which came with sauteed cauliflower, peas, green beans, and a couple strips of spinach.  The veggies were fresh, but the dish lacked flavor.  Maybe I was expecting some fresh herbs or more seasoning?  \\n\\nThe setting is a 4, the service is a 3-4, but the food which is the most important part - a 3.  I would go back to try one of the other two restaurants.  Lunch on the picnic benches or a nicer dinner at Quiessence, with daily menu changes, sounds appealing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "29      I went here for an early morning breakfast on a lovely Sunday morning 2 weeks ago for the 4th time. I had a terrible experience. It was tons of flies around while eating, the services wasn't good. The waitress was overwhelmed. The restaurant didn't have adequate silverware and no jelly. How can you serve breakfast and not have any jelly. I will not be back again to the Morning Glory Cafe.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

       "229881  The service from Unique is excellent, I stopped calling another shop in town as they were impossible to get on the phone. These guys took care of me.\\n\\nI went in to have my seats upgraded, the factory seat cushions were terrible and they did a great job in adding more foam but keeping the seat shape. We had a small part that broke on the side of the seat, but they took care of it with no hassle.

       "229884  Uninteresting. Not any different from Danny's or IHOP or similar. Tasted alright, was warm, relatively fast service. I do not know, what else would be there? I kind of was expecting something better then Danny's but was not really disappointed when it was not. It's alright, just do not expect anything special.\\n\\n\"Its alright\"\\n\\nEugene                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

       "229888  I went to this festival this year because I saw the free admission coupon in the newspaper and I have kids so anytime I can get in free with my kids is a plus!  Con:  Parking 4 blocks away in the 100 degree weather.   Pro: Gorgeous church and out of this world moussaka!  I wanted to take cooking class from them right then and there!  My 2 year old daughter liked the moussaka, too!  The bouncy houses were nice and fairly priced.  There was lots of room to run around and play.  I loved the food  variety they offered including hot dogs in case the little ones didn't care for Greek food.  The loukamades, though, were too expensive. The dolmades were unbelievably a bargain.  Three meat filled grape leaves for $2!  They charge $6-7 at a local restaurant for the same 3!  I ate 3 in their cafe and took another 3 home.  Spanakopita was also delicious.  Better than the restaurant!  I am so lucky to live in AZ with so many great festivals.  Not homesick anymore!  I've lived here in AZ for 9 years now, too.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "229889  I took the Grand Canyon via Sedona and Navajo Reservation tour.\\nSteve was our guide and was very informative but I would check my facts on Pluto, I don't think it's a star, it's classified as a dwarf planet.  He was very kind and helpful as I'm afraid of heights.  \\nI'm so glad that I took this tour instead trying to drive it myself and figure out where to go for the best scenery.\\nI didn't have any problem with any of the staff, I fact I had to cancel one of my party at the last minute (day before-well past the cutoff time) and they were very nice about not charging me for the canceled tour.\\nIf I'm lucky enough to make it to Phoenix again I would use them again!  It was very relaxing to let someone else do the driving.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "229890  Open Road Tours nearly ruined our vacation!  We booked our Grand Canyon tour several weeks in advance, but they called to cancel LAST MINUTE (literally 5pm on the Sunday before our Monday tour).  The customer service rep cited weather issues and told us that given their 25 years of experience, there would be fog in the canyon and it really wouldn't be worth the trip up there.\\n\\nAfter about an hour of wallowing in dejection, we optimistically decided to just try calling around to see if any other tour companies were operating.  Every single tour company we called (we went to tripadvisor and started with the highest rated) was still operating tours to the Grand Canyon but many of them were full.  We finally managed to snag the last 2 spots with another company and there were absolutely NO visibility issues at all.  In fact, the day was extremely clear and the Grand Canyon was spectacular.\\n\\nOpen Road Tours was extremely unprofessional in not helping us find an alternate way to see the Grand Canyon after we expressed that it was our whole purpose in visiting Phoenix and the day we booked was the only day we could go.  Rather than call peers to secure us spots, they told us there was nothing they could do unless we wanted to book on another day (impossible since we were leaving the next day).  Given that there were absolutely no actual weather issues, and they had actually already attempted to reschedule the tour prior to the \"weather cancellation\" due to insufficient bookings on Monday, the entire experience leaves a bad taste in my mouth.\\n\\nPARTING THOUGHT: Why take a chance with your vacation and book with an unreliable tour company when there are so many excellent options in the area?                                                                         \n",

I love the grilled sub roll. It's always crisp, soft and chewy - all at the same time.  When bread was first conceived, I believe that this was the Holy Grail of breads and Charley's has found it. \\n\\nI usually get some variant of the Philly Steak and have never been disappointed. My friend always gets the Buffalo Chicken and I think he's the real fan of this place. It's at his insistence that we come here. Even so, I'm always pleased and a bit let down that I didn't think of it.\\n\\nI noticed last week that they have a sign posted in the window that says they give a 10% discount for patrons of the AMC Theater next door.

       "229898  Do NOT sign a two year contract with this company! \\n\\nThe original deal I signed up for, was $61 for the first year, $85 after that. I'm only 9 months into this contract, and they notified me that per contract they were increasing my monthly payment by $5/month.... So now I'm at $66 for a few more months, and then it'll jump to $90. Okay, that sucks, but whatever.... \\n\\nI woke up today to discover they had dropped comedy central, nickelodeon, and about a dozen other good channels. I called them to cancel service (TV without The Daily Show isn't really worth having) but was told that I'd be charged the $300 cancellation fee. I explained since they were no longer able to provide the channels that I signed up for, they should let me out of this contract.... but I was told the contract clearly states that programming may change. \\n\\nSo basically, if you sign up with Directv, you are agreeing to give them money, whatever amount they choose... and they agree to give you 250 channels of infomercials... or whatever channels they choose. By the time you realize you are being screwed, it will be too late to cancel without penalty, and you will be stuck for two years!

       "229899  I have had DirecTV since mid 90's. I enjoy the quality but never the customer services... they treated you like thief and shit every time you called. It's a bit better now after losing significant business to Dish and local digital cables.\\n\\nUnfortunately, it continues to show arrogance... and consumer hostility. So I have been rotating among local cable, Dish, and Directv purely for cost saving and poor services.... so Directv will not be the sole beneficiary of my income.\\n\\nRecently I've signed up with Directv again and it's a bit disappointing on the service... as expected. But Devolution is the new name here.... a brand-new arena for Directv.\\n\\nThe flagship feature of new Directv is Cinema Plus... just another name for on demand... unfortunately it is and proudly so a pathetic downgrade. It's trying to fool you or train you to get used to the future habit... downloading movies.\\n\\nSo there are severely limited Primetime On Demand programs, comparing to its last version. Worst of its kind. And you have to \"order\" the On Demand programs... downloaded via your Internet. And there is a satellite dish out there....  Big Duh!\\n\\nI'm stuck with a 2-year contract, slightly cheaper monthly bill, and missing quite a few Primetime shows on CBC and ABC and CW and Fox and...\\n\\nSo shoppers, shop smarter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "229900  After reading a couple of the reviews on here I felt I should write a review based on my experience and advice my neighbor gave me, who is an installer.  The first thing you want to do is make sure you sign up through Directv corporate.  This means calling the number you see advertised on tv and through their website.  One reason for this is the installer must adhere to strict guidelines regarding dish mounting, cable runs and grounding.  The installer must also use only Directv approved cable and other installation materials.  To make sure these guidelines are followed, Directv sends quality control teams to randomly inspect installs.  This ensures you get a quality install which significantly lowers the chance  of service calls.\\n\\nThe other side of Directv is called the \"retail\" side.  These are independent contracters that set up booths inside of stores such as Best Buy, Walmart and Costco.  Generally these retailers are not bound by the rules of Directv corporate.  There are no quality control teams doing inspections and the installers can use substandard or cheaper cable and materials with no repercussions.  Also there may be extra installation charges called custom fees that Directv corporate usually would cover.  This includes special mounts that Directv gives away for free just to get your business.   Usually retailers aren't required to perform background checks on there installers.  \\n\\nOne last tip is regarding their protection plan.  Its a monthly fee you pay that covers you against service calls and equipment failure.  Usually resetting the receiver will resolve any issues.  If it seems like the receiver is just dead or you aren't getting any service, add the protection plan before you call in to schedule a service call so you aren't charged.   \n",
       "229901  Los Olivos is the furthest north carneceria I know of and it is pretty solid for being so. They have all your typical meats and are ready to marinate them upon request. They also have a decent selection of Mexican goods ranging from salsas and candy to beer and juices. You can also find fresh tortillas large and small. I love the small flour ones that you can't find in grocery stores for making tacos and other small items that don't require a 12\" tortilla. \\n\\nLos Olivos also has fresh salsas and gauc available. The green sauce is pretty tasty. The guac is a bit plain for my liking but I will pick some up in a pinch and add a little to it to kick it up a notch. \\n\\nYou don't need to speak Spanish to find your way around. I sure wish there were more carnicerias on the north side.

       "229903  Excellent carniceria in Peoria. I agree with other reviews, this is the most northern carniceria to where I live and I love it. Been here about 6 times ordering the carne asada and have never had a bad experience. Every time I cook the carne I get compliments and questions where I buy it. Great place!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "229904  I think I have died and gone to DVF heaven.  (That's Diane von Furstenberg for you non fashionistas out there.)  Seriously, by the time I was three racks into Twist I was melting into a puddle of bliss.  So many DVF styles and patterns....it should be illegal to sell that many in one place.  My poor heart can't take it.\\n\\nAnyways, after I regained my composure and continued shopping I was greeted with even more fabulous dresses and tops- Rebecca Taylor, Plenty, Lewis Cho....it was pure heaven.  The store is stocked with great fashion forward pieces....not fashion 4 months ago pieces. I almost sent a text message to Dorian G. telling her to get on the next plane and come out here to this store.  \\n\\nI selected 5 things to try on and halfway through the super nice (and cute) sales associate came by with a few more dresses to try on.  Everything he brought me fit perfectly and was right on with my style.  I seriously wanted to buy 8 things.  I restrained myself to come back with my husband to have him help me narrow them down.\\n\\nThe sales associates were super nice, the store is huge and full of wonderful items....what more could you want?  Oh yeah, I got a parking spot right in front.  That was cool too.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "229905  What a dream! This place is stocked to the brim but is not overwhelming. There are tons and tons of choices at various price points, so there is something for everyone here. I loved their dress selection - several were really unique and fun. Brands such as Velvet, Diane von Furstenberg, Frankie B, Corey Lynn Calter are the ones that come to mind when I remember this place. I just loved the selection of tops, jeans, dresses, skirts - dressy and casual. The girl that helped me was super friendly and helpful and not at all pretentious. I will definitely be back here to visit....nothing I tried on really wowed me this time, but there were so many things that I wished had worked because I truly loved them.

The concept is great, but the way in which the food is prepared is super disappointing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

       "4  Beautiful country setting in Phoenix on an old farm. Watch closely because it is easy to miss as it is actually an old farm near the Legacy Golf resort at South Mountain. \\nVery good home made breakfast with fresh ingredients from the farm. \\nOrange juice was fresh and tasty. \\nEggs and bacon were very good. Biscuits and gravy were excellent. \\nThe setting was the star of this breakfast!\\nI would recommend ! You won't be sorry !                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
